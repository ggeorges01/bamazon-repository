Welcome to Bamazon! This is an Amazon-like storefront built with MySQL and Node.js. 

Within the customer portal, the customer can view the inventory, select an item, by entering the product id, along with the quantity he/she wishes to buy. If the quantity of the item requested is available in stock, a message will display stating..Transaction complete!  if However, if there is not sufficient quantity available in stock to fulfill the order, the transaction 
will not go through. And, and a message will display stating...Insufficient Quantity! 

Within the manager portal, you can view all inventory in the store, view all low
inventory (less than 5 items in stock), choose to up the inventory back to the correct amount
needed, and even add new items to your inventory!
